    "## NDVI and Wildfires\n",
    "\n",
    "The effects of global warming are felt everywhere. While it is hard to quantify or compare exactly all of the effects, one of the most extreme we have been seeing is the increase of wildfires in the western US. Wildfires frequency has not just been increasing, but the severity of these burns has also been increasing. According to [this NASA visualization](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5453), wildfire burned area has been increasing. This is made worse due to the increased drought stress caused by increasing temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "While drought has many different definitions depending on who is talking about it, it is generally recognized as a lack of moisture in the environment causing stress. Drought can be hard to identify, but much research has been done on this topic. One method that has been developed to create a more robust system to identify drought utilizes NDVI. You can read more about this method [here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lei-Ji-5/publication/284778912_Drought_monitoring_with_NDVI-based_Standardized_Vegetation_Index/links/5acce2210f7e9b189654604d/Drought-monitoring-with-NDVI-based-Standardized-Vegetation-Index.pdf).\n",

    "In order to get a glimpse into this relationship, I am going to use the Waldo Canyon Fire as an area of study. The Waldo Canyon fire ignited June 23rd, 2012 and burned approximately 20,000 acres before being contained. It burned parts of El Paso and Teller counties, near Pikes Peak. According to [historical united states drought data](https://www.drought.gov/historical-information?dataset=0&selectedDateUSDM=20090707&state=Colorado&countyFips=08119), the region began seeing drought conditions September 2010 and fluxuated between abnormal dryness and extreme drought well past the fire. Lets look at NDVI leading up to this event to get an idea at what it looks like before a fire.\n",

    "### Step 1: Get Data\n",
    "First, we need to access the fire boundary. A great source for fire areas in the United States is [MTBS](https://www.mtbs.gov/). You can download an entire fire data package for any reported wildfire burned in the US. This is where I am going to source my Waldo Canyon Fire shapefile from. Move the .zip file into your data directory of choice. I recommend unzipping the file and renaming it, as it comes very nested and not with a very workable name."
